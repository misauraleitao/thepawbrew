This website is about a dog coffee shop in London. 
In this website you can find information about the establishment of the business, book a table,
see pictures and read each dog's profile as well as the coffee shop's menu.
I have designed this by making sure it is easy to navigate, clear and simple information and at the 
same time looking appealing and captivating to the user.

__UX__

This is a front-end only website. The audience targetted are people that might be interested
in visiting the cafe for the first time and therefore might want to book a table, read the menu 
or could be existing customers too.

__In order to achieve this I have created:__

- About us/Home Page where users can read through information about the business, the products
and where they rescue the dogs from.
- A review carousel so that users can read through and find confidence in the business.
- There is a gallery page called Meet The Pups which hosts pictures and brief profile descriptions
of all the dogs at the cafe.
- By clicking on the location icon on the navbar users can find an embed google maps iframe
with the exact pinpoint of the location of where the cafe is located. 
- If users would wish to make general enquires or request a table I have added a contact page 
where users are asked to fill out a form so that The Paw Brew staff can get in contact with them.
- On the footer section of all webpages users can find social media links, contact number, email and 
address as well as the option to input their email address in order to subscribe to a newsletter aswel as
recieving discounts and updates from The Paw Brew.
- The menu page allows the user to navigate through The Paw Brew's products and in there is also 
information about dietary requirements.

## First User Goals:

- Clear mapped location of the business.

## Returning visitor Goals:

# Design 

## Colours:
Colours used on this website are white, dark slate gray and dark slate green.

## Typography:
I have added Google Fonts "Londrina", and different classes from bootstrap like "lead" to make the website 
look more appealing.

## Imagery:
I have used black and white images and aestheticly pleasing images to give the impression of the rustic look.


# Wireframes
